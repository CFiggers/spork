# CJanet

A DSL that compiles to C. Improved version of jpm/cgen
that is more amenable to Janet integration, macros,
and meta-programming.

The semantics of the language are basically the
same as C so a higher level language (or type system)
should be built on top of this. This IR emits a very useful
subset of valid C 99.
